# MoonOclock
Converting Earth time into Organized, if Creative, Coordinated Universal Lunar Time (OCCULT).

# Lunar Time Converter



## Features

- Defines the relationship between Earth time and Lunar time based on the differing gravitational fields of Earth and the Moon.
- Implements a function to convert a given Earth time to a corresponding Lunar time taking into account the difference in gravitational fields.
- Considers the time dilation effect due to the weaker gravitational pull of the Moon compared to Earth.
- Accounts for the subtle changes in the speed of a lunar clock based on its position on the lunar surface due to the Moon's rotation.
- Optionally provides options for users to input Earth time and calculate the corresponding Lunar time based on the defined conversion mechanism.

### Context

'''
Lorentz time dilation, as described by special relativity, suggests that time passes differently for observers in different reference frames, especially when they are in relative motion. However, in the context of establishing a universal standard time on the Moon, Lorentz time dilation would not be the primary factor influencing timekeeping.

Instead, for establishing a universal standard time on the Moon, a suitable reference frame would need to be defined. One common approach is to use a standard timekeeping system based on an agreed-upon reference point, such as the position of the Sun or specific lunar landmarks. This timekeeping system would then be adopted universally by all parties involved in lunar activities.

~~1. ChatGPT prompt: How could Lorentz time dilation account for a literally universal standardization of Time on the Moon, if for instance I were establishing an intergovernmental Lunar time?
