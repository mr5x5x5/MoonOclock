# MoonOclock
Converting Earth time into Organized, if Creative, Coordinated Universal Lunar Time (OCCULT).

# Lunar Time Converter



## Features

- Defines the relationship between Earth time and Lunar time based on the differing gravitational fields of Earth and the Moon.
- Implements a function to convert a given Earth time to a corresponding Lunar time taking into account the difference in gravitational fields.
- Considers the time dilation effect due to the weaker gravitational pull of the Moon compared to Earth.
- Accounts for the subtle changes in the speed of a lunar clock based on its position on the lunar surface due to the Moon's rotation.
- Optionally provides options for users to input Earth time and calculate the corresponding Lunar time based on the defined conversion mechanism.
